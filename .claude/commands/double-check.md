# Command: Double Check

Please double check your work and what you generated. 
- Is it really complete? 
- Did you approach it from different angles? 

Define first at what angles you can approach it. 
Reiterate on the goal and what it means and what is required to achieve it.
Define what "complete" means in this context.

Proceed with the double check only after you are sure you have done all of the above.

Ultrathink!
